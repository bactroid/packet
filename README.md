# Packet Assembler

I felt like coding on my day off, and I didn't feel like working on any of my "real" projects. So I hit up /r/dailyprogrammer/ on Reddit and found this fun little challenge.

[Challenge #333 Packet Assembler](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/72ivih/20170926_challenge_333_easy_packet_assembler/?st=j8g8ut7k&sh=6972b56a)

I went for a mostly functional approach using Node since I basically write everything in Javascript when I can.

If you're bored and looking for interesting coding problems to stretch your mind a little hit up [the Daily Programmer subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/).

## Usage

```
cat challenge.txt | node index.js
